# TCP Implementation Work Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation and Packet Handling

1. Raw Socket Setup

   - ✅ Create raw socket interface
   - ✅ Handle IP packet encapsulation
   - ✅ Setup basic send/receive capabilities

2. TCP Header Implementation
   - ✅ Design header structure
   - ✅ Implement header serialization/deserialization
   - Create checksum calculation
   - Handle network byte order (big-endian)

## Phase 2: Connection Management

1. Connection States

   - Define state machine (CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, etc.)
   - Implement state transitions
   - Create connection tracking structure

2. Three-Way Handshake
   - SYN packet generation and sending
   - SYN-ACK handling and validation
   - Final ACK sending
   - Connection establishment confirmation

## Phase 3: Basic Data Transfer

1. Segmentation

   - Break data into appropriate segments
   - Handle sequence numbers
   - Manage acknowledgment numbers

2. Send/Receive Logic
   - Implement data sending mechanism
   - Create receive buffer
   - Handle in-order packet processing
   - Basic flow control implementation

## Phase 4: Connection Termination

1. Closing States
   - Implement FIN handling
   - Handle FIN-WAIT states
   - Manage TIME-WAIT state
   - Clean resource cleanup

## Phase 5: Reliability Features

1. Error Detection

   - Implement retransmission timer
   - Handle packet loss detection
   - Manage duplicate packets

2. Flow Control
   - Window size management
   - Sliding window implementation
   - Buffer management

## Testing Plan

1. Unit Testing

   - Header parsing/creation
   - Checksum validation
   - State transitions

2. Integration Testing

   - Connection establishment
   - Data transfer
   - Connection termination

3. Reliability Testing
   - Packet loss handling
   - Out-of-order packets
   - Flow control effectiveness

## Optional Advanced Features

1. Performance Improvements

   - Window scaling
   - Selective acknowledgments (SACK)
   - Nagle's algorithm

2. Congestion Control

   - Slow start
   - Congestion avoidance
   - Fast retransmit/recovery

3. Additional Features
   - TCP options handling
   - Keep-alive mechanism
   - Urgent data handling
